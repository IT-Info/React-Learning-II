we should not use DOM directly, we should use state to control elements

the elements should sync with state of component.
so we created state descriptiona and count
and attached with element, element start rendering the value of state variable
but whenever we change the value of dropdown (count) it will not change on ui, because state not changed yet.

if we add value={description} then error on console will be
You provided a `value` prop to a form field without an `onChange` handler. This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use `defaultValue`. Otherwise, set either `onChange` or `readOnly`.

we should change state on change so that element should also changed
you can check console

Q. What is the difference b/w state & props
A. state is internal data owned by component,
props is external data owned by parent component.

so we will pass list of items to the ItemList and ItemList then display the components on page.

Q. But what if ItemList and Form component in parallel ?
