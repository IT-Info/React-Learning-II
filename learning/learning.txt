to creating folder structure like this

> npx create-react-app@5 learning

you can create app using vite also, 
that is fast but does not contains 
eslint (code errors, best practices), 
jest (for testing),

you have to manually setup these modules

check package.json to view installed modules


you can change view by adding html tags in App.js

return (
    <your html>
);

NOTE : check warning log is defined but never used, given by plugin (eslint).
